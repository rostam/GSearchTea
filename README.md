# GSearchTea

Welcome to the GSearchTea repository! GSearchTea is a project focused on improving search capabilities in graph space using Apache Flink and Apache Spark.

## Overview

GSearchTea leverages the power of both batch and stream processing to efficiently handle graph data. The process includes reading from G6 files, converting the data into a graph in parallel, computing a parameter, and returning the results.

## Features

- **Streaming vs Batch Processing**: GSearchTea uses both streaming and batch processing to handle large volumes of graph data efficiently.
- **G6 File Reading**: The software is capable of reading graph data from G6 files using Apache Flink and Spark.
- **Parallel Graph Conversion**: GSearchTea can convert the read data into a graph in parallel, leveraging the power of distributed computing.
- **Parameter Computation**: The software can compute a parameter on the graph data.
- **Result Return**: After computation, GSearchTea returns the results.
